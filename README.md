## Probabilistic machine learning
### - Bayesian neural network
we compare the non-Bayesian and Bayesian neural network which share similar architecture. Bayesian NN provides uncertainty in its prediction while non-Bayesian NN only provides point esitmates. MNIST dataset is used.
### - EM algorithm in Gaussian mixture model
Derive EM algorithmm for general case. Implement EM algorithms for GMM.
